This was the task for the recruitment process. As I received great feedback, I decided to publish it to show my approach to the problem, although I had to erase some sensitive information. The analysis was performed on simulated data, so the outcomes are not realistic. That was my first A/B testing project and I know that there are were places for improvement.

## Problem

Given the data from a control group, I had to provide a list of users which should be the most profitable during a new campaign. 

## Implementation

I used **R** and its **Tidyverse** universe. Everything was written in a single **RMarkdown** notebook.
